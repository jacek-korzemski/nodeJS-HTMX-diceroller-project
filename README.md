# Simple Websocket app for rolling dice

## But also a great example, of how to integrate WebSockets backend with Frontend in Monolith infrastructure

Simple monolith application, using websockets for rolling dice. UI is using EJS to inject variables, and HTMX to handle UI.
But you can also build any UI framework like React or Vue into html directory.

I'm shareing it (beside - auto render.com deploy), becouse when I was learning about Websockets I came across some issues, that I couldn't figure out,
something about updating UI after coming message or something. Maybe this repo will be a little help for U ðŸ’›
